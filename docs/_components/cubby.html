  <p>Cubby is an evolution UI component that attempts to make displaying tabular data a little more space efficient.  It does this by hiding part of the content in a <code>td</code> element with the class of <code>.evo_c-cubby</code> in a <code>table</code> behind other data.  Content within the <code>td class="evo_c-cubby</code> tag is split into two <code>div</code>s, the first with a class of <code>.evo_c-cubby__door</code> and the second with a class of <code>.evo_c-cubby__inside</code>.  On hovering of the <code>td</code> cell, it creates the effect of a door swinging open to reveal the hidden content behind the first <code>div class="evo_c-cubby__door</code> tag.  This component requires no JavaScript.  The helper class <code>.evo_h-cubby-table</code> defines an arbitrary height value and width of 100% for the table containing cubby so content doesn't become hidden behind the component.</p>

  <p>One limitation of this component is that it requires <code>hover</code> state to be firing within the client which may make it unsuitable for mobile uses.  Also, the content of both <code>div</code>s should be about the same amout to prevent content in <code>inside</code> to peak out from behind content from <code>door</code> until this can be remedied.</p>
